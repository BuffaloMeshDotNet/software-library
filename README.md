# software-library
Basically, a way to seed a software library for first time use.

The file 'filelist' should be populated with the name of the download, it's category, and a URL to seed from.  It's tab delimited.  To begin the seed, enter:
sudo ./seedit

The sudo command is needed, because it's writing things to /var/www/html.
